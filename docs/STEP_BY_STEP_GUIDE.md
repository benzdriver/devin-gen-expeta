# Step-by-Step Guide: Using Expeta to Generate a Personal Blog Website

This guide documents the complete process of using Expeta 2.0 to generate a personal website with blog functionality, from initial requirements to final deployment.

## 1. Starting the Process: Requirement Input

### Initial Requirement
Begin by expressing your need in natural language:
```
"I need a personal website with a blog functionality"
```

### Accessing the Clarifier
1. Navigate to the Expeta 2.0 interface
2. Select the "Chat Requirements" option from the sidebar
3. Enter your initial requirement in the chat input field
4. Click "Send" to begin the conversation with the Clarifier

## 2. Multi-Round Clarification Process

### Round 1: Initial Clarification
The Clarifier (acting as a product manager) will respond with questions to better understand your requirements:

**Clarifier**: "As your product manager, I need to understand your requirements in more depth to provide the best solution for you. Could you tell me which industry or domain this project belongs to? What kind of visual style are you looking for (modern, minimalist, colorful, etc.)? Do you have any color schemes or UI/UX patterns in mind?"

**User Response**: "I want a creative portfolio website to showcase my design work. I prefer a modern, minimalist style with a light color scheme."

### Round 2: Feature Clarification
**Clarifier**: "Thank you for that information. Could you provide more details about the specific features you need for your blog? For example, do you need categories, tags, comments, or any other specific functionality?"

**User Response**: "Yes, I'd like the blog to have categories and comments. I also need a portfolio section to showcase my projects with images and descriptions."

### Round 3: Design Preferences
**Clarifier**: "Great! For the visual design aspects:
- What color scheme would you prefer (light, dark, colorful, monochrome, etc.)?
- How important is modern CSS styling and visual appeal in your project?
- Do you have any preferences for typography or font styles?"

**User Response**: "I prefer a light color scheme with accent colors. Modern CSS styling is very important to me. I like clean, sans-serif fonts."

### Round 4: Confirmation
**Clarifier**: "Based on our conversation, I understand you need a personal website with:
1. A modern, minimalist design with a light color scheme
2. A portfolio section to showcase your design work with images and descriptions
3. A blog with categories and comments functionality
4. Clean, sans-serif typography
5. Modern CSS styling for visual appeal

Is this understanding correct?"

**User Response**: "Yes, that's exactly what I need."

## 3. Expectation Model Generation

After confirming your requirements, the Clarifier generates a structured expectation model:

```json
{
  "id": "test-creative-portfolio",
  "name": "Creative Portfolio Website",
  "description": "A personal website with portfolio and blog functionality",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Must have portfolio showcase",
    "Must have blog functionality",
    "Must have contact form"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must be responsive",
    "Must be accessible",
    "Must use modern CSS styling"
  ],
  "level": "top",
  "sub_expectations": [
    {
      "id": "sub-exp-1",
      "name": "Portfolio Component",
      "description": "Portfolio showcase with project details",
      "parent_id": "test-creative-portfolio"
    },
    {
      "id": "sub-exp-2",
      "name": "Blog System",
      "description": "Blog with categories and comments",
      "parent_id": "test-creative-portfolio"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Code Generation

### Initiating Code Generation
1. Navigate to the "Code Generation" page in the Expeta interface
2. The expectation model is automatically loaded if you came from the Chat Requirements page
3. If not, enter the expectation ID (e.g., "test-creative-portfolio") and click "Load"
4. Review the expectation details
5. Click the "Generate Code" button to start the code generation process

### Generation Process
The Generator component transforms the expectation model into working code:

1. Analyzing the expectation model
2. Determining the appropriate technology stack (Flask for backend, HTML/CSS/JS for frontend)
3. Creating the file structure
4. Generating code for each component
5. Implementing the portfolio showcase
6. Implementing the blog system with categories and comments
7. Creating responsive, modern CSS styling
8. Implementing the contact form

### Generated Files
The Generator produces a complete codebase including:

1. **app.py**: Flask application with routes for all pages
2. **templates/index.html**: Homepage with featured works and recent posts
3. **templates/blog.html**: Blog listing page with categories
4. **templates/blog_post.html**: Individual blog post page with comments
5. **templates/portfolio.html**: Portfolio listing page
6. **templates/portfolio_item.html**: Individual portfolio item page
7. **templates/about.html**: About page
8. **templates/contact.html**: Contact page with form
9. **static/css/style.css**: Responsive styling for all pages

## 5. Code Validation

The Validator component verifies that the generated code meets the requirements specified in the expectation model:

- ✅ Portfolio showcase implementation
- ✅ Blog functionality with categories and comments
- ✅ Contact form implementation
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessible markup
- ✅ Modern CSS styling

## 6. Deployment Process

### Initiating Deployment
1. On the Code Generation page, after the code has been generated and validated
2. Click the "Deploy Website" button
3. The system will prepare the deployment environment and start the local server

### Deployment Steps
The deployment process includes:

1. Setting up the Flask application environment
2. Creating sample data for blog posts and portfolio items
3. Ensuring all templates are available
4. Starting the Flask application on localhost:5000

### Accessing the Deployed Website
Once deployed, you can access your website at the provided URL. The website includes:

1. **Homepage**: Featuring your recent works and blog posts
2. **Blog**: With categories and comments functionality
3. **Portfolio**: Showcasing your projects with filtering options
4. **About**: Information about you
5. **Contact**: A form for visitors to reach out

## 7. Testing the Website

After deployment, you should test all functionality:

1. Navigate between pages using the menu
2. Test the blog category filtering
3. View individual blog posts and check comments
4. Test the portfolio filtering
5. Fill out and submit the contact form
6. Verify responsive design by resizing the browser window

## 8. Conclusion

This step-by-step guide demonstrates how Expeta 2.0 transforms natural language requirements into a fully functional personal website with blog capabilities through:

1. **Intelligent requirement clarification**: Multi-round dialogue to understand user needs
2. **Structured expectation modeling**: Converting requirements to a formal model
3. **Code generation**: Creating a complete website codebase
4. **Validation**: Ensuring the code meets all requirements
5. **Deployment**: Making the website accessible with minimal effort

The entire process, from initial requirement input to final deployment, showcases Expeta's ability to understand user needs, create appropriate expectations, and generate high-quality code that meets those expectations.
